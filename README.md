# Maersk Challenge 2


## Project Brief
Write a program to check if two given String is Anagram of each other. Your function should return true if two Strings are Anagram, false otherwise. A string is said to be an anagram if it contains the same characters and same length, but in a different order, e.g. army and Mary are anagrams. You can ignore cases for this problem,
                                     
## Dependencies used
* JUnit 5.6.0 https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.junit.jupiter/junit-jupiter-api
 
## How to Run
- Give step by step instructions
    1. Open the project in Intellij
    2. Navigate to the Main.java file in the project explorer
    3. Run the main method

## Highlights
- Works efficiently
- Thoroughly tested for robustness
- Single character values work
- Capitalisation is accounted for

## Improvements
- The spaces within the strings are not ignored, which could have been considered
